    <string name="about_renukai_classes_para1">In this competitive environment, every student aspires to get admission in a 
	    reputed Medical or Engineering college. For that the student needs to stay ahead of the competition. 
	    The student needs to study hard and prepare oneself in such a way that no one can challenge one’s academic abilities.</string>
    <string name="about_renukai_classes_para2">There is an observation that many students who score well in 10th and 12th state board score not as well 
in the CET exam. This does not mean that such students are not able to study but that they are unable to study ‘SMART’ for the CET. 
Keeping this in mind, Prof. Motegaonkar has developed different smart methods to make learning Chemistry fun and help students score the maximum in their respective examinations.</string>
